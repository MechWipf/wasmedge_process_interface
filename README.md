# Rust Process Interface Library

A Rust library that provides Rust to WebAssembly developers with syntax for running commands functionality when their Wasm is being executed on [SecondState's SSVM](https://github.com/second-state/SSVM).

From a high-level overview here, we are essentially building a process interface that will allow the native operating system (which SSVM is running on) to play a part in the runtime execution. Specifically, play a part in executing commands with arguments and environment values as part of Wasm execution.
